Setup:
Unzip - Open html file, make sure to be connected to the internet.
Alternative (preferred, but not) - open folder with vs-code - open live server (on live server you'll
see the line graph for the first chart). 

I am sad to say I did not complete this task 100%. I managed to create a reuseable data
component for the donut chart, it reads from a dataset inside the MAIN.JS - I also 
created a csv file, included in the DATA folder, which stores the values for the line graph.
I did successfully create a line graph for the first donut chart. I ran out of time. I am about to board
an airplane to Iceland, and I have been travelling all day. I thought I send this now, in-complete,
and I hope I can explain what I was trying to do. I created the html skeleton and was trying to output 
the relevant data in there. Successfully and un-successfully. 

This is the first D3js project I do, I have copy pasted what the data scientist at my company has made,
but not written functions for pulling any data like this. It looks good, in my opinion, very close to 
what you sent me, but not pixel-perfect and I created a carousel that works both on the desktop 
and mobile.

I am sure that if I had a little more time, and if this test would have been for this week, I could 
have done a much better job. The company I am working with is going live today (9/9) so I have been
juggling this test, and fixing bugs our tester finds. I also recently came from a camping trip in 
California. I am not trying to make excuses, I stand by my project, I am just giving you an idea how
busy I have been the past few days, and that I would love to have an opportunity at Marfeel to become
better. I do lack knowledge in some areas, but I am more than willing to go beyond to become better
as a developer.

I have used this carousel before, it is based on the Bootstrap carousel, I found it on StackOverflow.

I am a little embarrassed to confess this, but I have never done unit testing, and looking for methods
in this little time I had, felt a bit overwhelming. Working for a startup, as the main front-end developer
with no experience, I have had to learn a lot of methods and practices by doing it wrong first and working 
my way through the problem. But like I said before, I didn't have the luxury of time to make all those 
mistakes and learn from them.

I hope you see some potential in me, I am driven and passionate and I want to learn and add to my experience.
